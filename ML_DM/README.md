Materials for Machine Learning & Data Mining of USTC Autumn 2021

Scope of Examination: 《机器学习》周志华 Ch.2-Ch.11,Ch.13

Recollections of Exam:

1. 1) Which model do we choose when dealing with 
   2) What is normalization？Which of the following algorithms demands normalization？LR, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, kNN.
   3) The reason or description of introducing $L_1\ &\ L_2$ norm regularization to models. Since introducing regularization means introducing priori distribution to parameters, like $L_1$ introduces Laplacian distribution, what distribution does $L_2$ norm regularization introduce?

2.(Decision Tree) A sheet of several features to distinguish Martians & Humans，features consist of {Green,Legs,Height,Smelly}, each has two statuses:
   1) Construct a decision tree with ID3 algorithm
   2) The decision tree constructed by ID3 algorithm is not optimum，Can you construct a decision tree with only 3 features whose training error equals to 0?
   3) What can we do when the values of feature is continuous?

3.(PCA) A $2\times5$ data matrix is given. Use PCA to transform the matrix from 2-dimensional to 1-dimensional.
